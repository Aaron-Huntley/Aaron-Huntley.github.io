## Things I'm currently interested in

**Locally lambda-Presentable Double Categories**

**Compact Closed Double Categories**

## Things I've been interested in

**A infinity-Algebras and omega-Categories**

**Analysing Semantic Data**
There was a time I had access to a some data collected by Psycologists to probe 'semantic space' I was interested in how we could analyse this data to learn about how the human brain thinks 'semantically'. 

## Things I've written

**[The Dold-Kan Correspondance](/notes_pdf/dold_kan.pdf)**  
These notes were in preperation for a talk I gave for a class in Stable Homotopy theory.

**[Introduction to Quasi-categories](/notes_pdf/quasicats.pdf)**  
These notes were born out of trying to understand infinity categories. It was also a final project for a course in Homotopical Algebra I took at Western University.

**[Notes on Category Theory](/notes_pdf/cat_notes.pdf)** 
You can find these notes on this website. However, if I haven't gotten around to fixing the script which converts the latex to html then you can find the pdf here. 
I wrote these notes in my last year at the University of Leeds, since then I have not made any changes. That is to say please take them with a grain of salt.

**[Symmetries of Escherâ€™s Paintings](/notes_pdf/escher_notes.pdf)**  
The enumeration of the 17 wallpaper groups is a delightful piece of matematics I think everyone should see. 
I wrote these notes in the third year of my time in Leeds.
