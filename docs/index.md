Hello! I'm a mathematician and PhD candidate at Case Western Reserve University. Currently I'm interested in exploring ideas in double category theory. In particular, I want to understand notions of presentable double categories, compact closed double categrories and their use in answering questions in higher cateogroy theory. Beyond this, I am drawn to all ideas that explore the search for truth and the beauty it reveals.

Here, you'll find:

- **About Me**: A description of my given talks, papers and events I helped organise.
- **Mathematical Notes**: [IN PROGRESS] A collection of notes documenting my mathematical journeyâ€”ranging from polished to exploratory.

If you find something here that resonates with you, feel free to reach out to me at **axh1127 [at] case [dot] edu**.
